# DTGCN

This page shows the original code and data samples of the paper 'Multi-Stage Malaria Parasites Recognition by Deep Transfer Graph Convolutional Network'.


The image samples can be downloaded in [Dataset](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/xvs55d4rcz/draft?a=6223e44e-04b8-4705-91d9-bf98665c6194).

The code in this page is for multi-stage malaria prasites recognition. Please revised the parameters in 'config.py' when conduct on other datasets.

A CNN feature collection and trained model are in '/Model_and_Log/'.

#Detailed Setting
We have released the code under a OSI compliant license (MIT) with a license file in GitHub (https://github.com/senli2018/DTGCN) and mentioned in our paper.

The code and trained model can be downloaded from GitHub, and the detail information is described below.
